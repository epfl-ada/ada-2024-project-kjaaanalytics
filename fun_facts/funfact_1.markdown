To begin his journey, Bob will travel to England. On his way to England, he sits next to a very nice Englishman, and they start discussing Bob’s favorite subject: BEERS. He learns that the English really enjoy beer, and they start discussing different preferences for beer styles. However, this English man knows way too many styles, and this is very confusing to Bob. To help Bob, we grouped the most popular beer styles into 17 different categories.

He is now relieved and can compare the differences between Swiss and English preferences. To help Bob compare the different beer styles, we plotted a bar chart comparing the 17 beer styles' average rating scores in Switzerland and England. The plot is generated so that as we go to the right of the plot, the difference between the two countries decreases.

Overall, Bob learns on his journey to England that the two most appreciated beer styles in England are Stout and Porter! He also finds out that the average rating of the 2 countries differs the most for low alcohol beers. While England seems to rather enjoy this type of beer, Swiss people do not seem fond of low alcohol beers. Let’s follow along Bob’s journey to England!

→ The beer style that is rated the most differently between the two countries is Low Alcohol one.

→ The beer style that is rated approximately the same in both countries is Strong Ale!
